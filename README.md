## FAQs
- What happened to the original Trello Bot?

The original Trello Bot (Trello#5300) has now been shutdown. This is the continuation of that project.

- Why is the bot called Taco, but the repository is called TrelloBot

Taco is the name of our "official" hosted copy. This repository is the code used for the bot and can be used to selfhost TrelloBot yourself.

- Why are there no selfhosting instructions yet?

We're currently not going to add selfhosting instructions until we're sure that the bot is stable. However, if you really need to selfhost this bot now, you can message Yamboy1#3959 or Coolguy3289#2290 on the Support Server, and they can help you set it up. Please note that until version 7.0.0 is released, this bot is currently in beta and lots of things are still likely to change, so please check the changelogs before updating your bot to a new version.
